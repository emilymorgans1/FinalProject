On our front end if a user uploads a picture and clicks identify, the machine identifies and predicts few options and then the user chooses a language to translate the predicts to Spanish, French or Italian.

On the back end we have used Xception (the pretrained model) to do the predictions for Machine Learning part. Google translate API translates the predictions.

Final deployment is on Heroku.
